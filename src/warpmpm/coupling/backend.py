"""WarpMPMBackend: the stable coupling surface between a robot sim and the MPM material.

The robot sim owns the robot's dynamics; this backend owns the material and exchanges only
compact kinematics (in) and reaction wrenches (out) per contact tool -- never particles.
This is the contract MuJoCo plugs into now and Isaac Lab plugs into later, unchanged.

A "tool" is a kinematic box end-effector. It is driven by the START-of-tick centre plus a
per-tick velocity: the fork's modify_bc advances point += dt*velocity on every substep, so
over one control tick the box sweeps centre -> centre + dt_ctrl*velocity and lands exactly
on the commanded target. The imposed grid velocity is what presses the material; a tool at
rest (velocity 0) acts as a static no-slip boundary that holds the material. The reaction
wrench is the compressive-gated stress integral (coupling/wrench.py).
