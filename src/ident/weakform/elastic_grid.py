"""Grid-consistent (Bubnov-Galerkin) weak form for the fixed-corotated elastic pair.

Why this module exists. The elastic recovery in the TrackEUCLID tree used an
analytic radial window in the REFERENCE configuration (a squared radial bump,
zero on a sphere surface). On a sphere that window vanishes where the material
ends, so the free-surface and floor-contact tractions drop out and the recovery
is accurate. On a cube the same window does not vanish on the faces, the floor
contact traction leaks into the residual, and the recovered stiffness is biased
by order ten percent. The fix is the same one that was load-bearing for the
granular case (``ident/weakform/grid_assembly.py``): test on the discrete space
the forward solver itself uses, the quadratic B-spline grid basis, and read the
residual node by node.

The discrete MPM momentum balance is exact at every grid node the collider does
not touch. warp-mpm deposits the internal force as

    f_i = - sum_p V_p^0 tau_p grad N_i(x_p),        tau = J sigma (Kirchhoff)

and then ``grid_normalization_and_gravity`` sets
v_out = v_in / m_i + dt g. So for a node whose velocity the collider never
overwrites,

    sum_p V_p^0 tau_p[d,:] . grad N_i(x_p) = m_i (g - a_i)_d,
    m_i = sum_p m_p N_i(x_p).

Nothing was assumed about the free surface: a node at the surface carries the
balance just as an interior node does, because the traction MPM applies there is
identically zero. That is what removes the need for a shape-fitted window.

Linearity in theta. For the fixed corotated model with energy
psi = mu ||F - R||_F^2 + (lam/2) (J - 1)^2 the Kirchhoff stress is

    tau = mu * 2 (F - R) F^T  +  lam * J (J - 1) I,

which is exactly ``kirchoff_stress_FCR`` in the fork, so the two stress columns
are read off with no approximation. In Cauchy form (the form the plan states)

    sigma_mu  = (2 / J) (F - R) F^T,     sigma_lam = (J - 1) I.

Updated-Lagrangian pairing, stated once so it cannot drift. Volumes and stresses
are paired as CURRENT volume with CAUCHY stress, V_p = J_p V_p^0 with sigma_p.
That product is identically V_p^0 tau_p, the pairing the engine uses, so the two
readings agree to the last bit and the assembler carries the reference volume
plus J rather than a separately dumped current volume. Mass is frame invariant,
m_p = rho_0 V_p^0 = (rho_0 / J_p) (J_p V_p^0), so the load term needs no J at
all. Both stress columns are symmetrized before use, matching the engine's own
``(tau + tau^T) / 2``.

The load. The exact statement carries the GRID acceleration a_i, which a dump of
particle trajectories does not hold. The load here is the mass-weighted
particle-acceleration interpolation

    b_(i,d) = sum_p m_p (g - a_p)_d N_i(x_p),

consistent to the temporal discretization in the same sense as
``grid_assembly.py`` documents for the granular case (G2P makes v_p a nodal
interpolation, so the particle sum is a mass-weighted smoothing of the nodal
accelerations, not a different quantity).

Node gating, three reasons a node is dropped:
  1. Collider reach. ``collide`` in the fork overwrites grid_v_out at nodes with
     dot(x_i - point, normal) < 0, so those nodes carry an unmodelled contact
     impulse. The contamination also travels: a kept node reads particles within
     1.5 dx, and those particles read nodes within a further 1.5 dx, so a margin
     of about 3 cells is needed for the interpolated load to be clean. The
     margin is a parameter and the gate run reports its sensitivity.
  2. Support mass. A node with little mass in its support has a small, noisy
     balance and the largest particle-to-node interpolation error.
  3. Non-finite or inverted F anywhere in the support. Such a particle's stress
     column is meaningless even though the engine consumed it, so the node's row
     is dropped rather than trusted.

    """Least-squares (optionally ridge) solve for (mu, lambda).

    Works for any number of columns. theta and theta_sd are always returned;
    when there are exactly two columns the elastic names (mu, lam, E, nu) are
    added, since that is what the elastic call sites read.

    Columns can differ in magnitude by orders of magnitude on a nearly
    incompressible motion, so the normal equations are formed on
    column-normalized data and the scaling is undone afterwards. cond(A^T A) is
    reported on the RAW columns, which is the number the gate asks for.
