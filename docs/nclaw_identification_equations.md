# What each material's identification computes, and from what data

All four identifications share one principle. Newton's second law for the
body, written against the grid basis functions N_j and integrated in time
against a window w(t) that vanishes at both ends:

    sum_p V_p sigma_p(theta) : (e_d outer grad N_j(x_p)) accumulated with w(t)
      = - sum_p V_p rho (a_p - g) . e_d N_j(x_p) accumulated with w(t),

where the time integration by parts replaces the acceleration a_p by stored
velocities, so no differentiation of data is needed. The stress sigma_p(theta)
is the material law evaluated on the stored deformation gradient F_p. Every
law below is linear in its unknowns, so the rows stack into A theta = b and
one least-squares solve gives theta. No simulator runs during identification;
no stress or pressure measurement is read. Wall time is seconds per material.

## Jelly (their corotated law), unknowns mu and lambda

    sigma(F) = (2 mu / J) (F - R) F^T + lambda (J - 1) I,
    R from the polar decomposition of F, J = det F.

Two columns, one solve. Recovered: mu and lambda giving E within 1.9 percent,
nu within 4 percent.
Data: positions, velocities, deformation gradients, particle volume, density,
gravity.

## Plasticine (their Hencky law with a von Mises cap), unknowns mu, lambda, tau_y

Elastic pair, same momentum fit with Hencky columns:

    tau(F) = U diag(2 mu eps + lambda tr(eps)) U^T,  eps = log Sigma(F).

Yield stress from a level in the data: the return map caps the deviatoric
elastic strain of every flowing particle at

    || dev eps || = tau_y / (2 mu),

so the flowing particles all sit at one strain level. Read that level,
multiply by the recovered 2 mu:

    tau_y = 2 mu * plateau of || dev eps(F_p) || over flowing particles.

Recovered: E 0.9 percent, nu 0.5 percent, tau_y 1.0 percent. (This section
always stated the Hencky columns; the code used corotated columns until an
external review caught the mismatch, and the earlier errors of 1.8, 3.4 and
1.1 percent were that mismatch's cost.)
Data: positions, velocities, deformation gradients, volume, density, gravity.
The yield stress uses the deformation gradient only.

## Sand (their Drucker-Prager), unknown: friction angle

Pressure is computed, not measured, the same way their own module defines it:

    p(F) = mean stress of the Hencky law on F at the configured E = 1e6,
           nu = 0.2 (both sides fix these; their fit also adjusts only the
           friction angle).

This reconstruction matches their stored pressure to 0.014 percent, because
their pipeline itself computes stress from F. On flowing particles the yield
condition ties shear stress to pressure:

    sqrt(J2(dev sigma)) / p = mu_c,   sin(phi) = 3 mu_c / (2 sqrt(3) + mu_c),

so every flowing particle-step reports mu_c, and the level of that
distribution is the estimate. Recovered: phi = 24.98 degrees against 25.0.
The momentum fit was also run, returned 0.87 at a residual of 0.48, and is
recorded as refused; the residual rule (bar 0.15) selects the estimator.
Data: deformation gradients, the fixed elastic constants, flow detection from
velocity gradients. No pressure or stress measurement.

## Water (their linear volume law), unknown: stiffness lambda_w

    sigma(F) = lambda_w (J - 1) I,   J = det F.

One column in the momentum fit: the observed decelerations beyond gravity
must be produced by the pressure this law generates, and lambda_w is the one
number that closes the balance. Recovered: 58001 Pa against 57692, within
0.54 percent.
Data: positions, velocities, deformation gradients (for J), volume, density,
gravity.

## Conversions used

    E = mu (3 lambda + 2 mu) / (lambda + mu),   nu = lambda / (2 (lambda + mu)).

## Final table, no stress values used anywhere

Rollouts: our engine from their frame-0 particles at their step, their wall
behavior enabled, their water law behind the comparison flag, scored on
their trajectories with their metric.

Information ledger, one line per material:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| jelly | yes | yes | none | law form known |
| plasticine | yes | yes (also for tau_y) | none | law form known |
| sand | yes (flow detection) | yes (also gives pressure) | none | law form known; E, nu fixed as theirs are |
| water | yes | yes (volume change) | none | law form known |

NCLaw's loss compares positions only, but its training uses teacher
forcing: at scheduled steps the simulator state is reset to the stored
ground truth, x, v, C, F together (experiments/train.py, the is_teacher
branch; their dataset class loads x, v, C, F and stress per frame, with
stress loaded and discarded). The F they inject is the post-return-map
elastic deformation gradient, the state a plastic material hides from
positions. Their appendix D.2 describes the scheme as restarting "from the
ground-truth position"; the code restarts the full state. At test time
their rollout starts from an initial condition built from the config, with
the throw velocity given exactly, and the metric reads positions every
fifth frame. The like-for-like comparison at their information level is
therefore the no-stress tier above, and every cell of it beats their
published numbers. The positions-only tier below, where velocities and
deformation gradients are rebuilt from positions by local fits and even the
frame-0 velocity is a finite difference, is stricter than anything NCLaw
does at training or test.

## Recovered versus assumed, per material

Assumed everywhere: the form of each law (their configs state it), the scene
facts (density, particle volume, gravity, the initial state), and the
comparison-only engine options that reproduce their integrator. Within that,
what the data determines:

- jelly: both constants recovered (mu, lambda from the momentum fit; E
  within 1.9 percent, nu within 4 percent). Nothing assumed.
- plasticine: all three constants recovered, in a chain, with the Hencky
  stress columns of its generating elasticity (an external review caught the
  earlier corotated columns; the fix halved every error). The momentum fit
  returns mu = 1.1879e5 and lambda = 1.2002e5 (E within 0.9 percent, nu
  within 0.5 percent). The yield stress then uses the recovered mu, not a
  given one: the flowing particles share one deviatoric strain level,
  0.020834, and tau_y = 2 x 118794 x 0.020834 = 4950 Pa, within 1.0 percent.
- sand: E = 1e6 and nu = 0.2 are assumed at their configured values; only
  the friction angle is recovered (24.98 against 25.0 degrees). Two reasons
  this is the honest setup. It is symmetric: their sys-id baseline also
  fixes E and nu for sand and fits only the friction angle. And the
  physics: at E = 1e6 the grains deform elastically by about 0.1 percent
  during the collapse, so the trajectory carries almost no signal about E
  and the rollout is nearly insensitive to it. A parameter the motion
  neither reveals nor responds to is better fixed and declared than fitted
  and overclaimed.
- water: the one stiffness recovered (within 0.54 percent). Nothing assumed
  beyond the law form.

Two checks that would turn sand's assumption into a measurement, not yet
run: the elastic momentum fit on sand's pre-yield strains, to put a
condition number on how poorly E is determined; and a rollout at a
deliberately wrong E, say half, to measure how little the trajectory
responds. Both take minutes.

## Positions only: what breaks, what refuses, what ships

The positions-only tier rebuilds every channel from particle positions:
velocities by central finite differences, gradients and deformation by
moving least squares. Jelly and water pass through the standard estimators
at this tier. The two plastic materials do not, and the chain of
measurements below says exactly why.

The stored deformation gradient of a plastic material is the elastic part,
because the return map overwrites F every step. Positions can only give the
total deformation. On the plasticine dataset throw the stored elastic
deviatoric strain caps at 0.0208 while the total strain reaches 1.7 by the
last frame, an 80x divergence. The first positions-only run fed the total
deformation to estimators expecting the elastic state and returned E ten
times low and the yield twelve times high without refusing; that silent
failure is what this section repairs.

The information is present in principle. Handed the true hidden elastic
state, the momentum fit that treats every sub-yield particle's full stress
as data recovers the yield stress to 1.5 percent, better than the no-stress
tier's flow-set-only fit (11.5 percent low). The failure is reconstruction,
not identification.

The reconstruction attempt is the replay estimator
(mpm_engine/experiments/nclaw/replay.py): fit per-frame deformation
increments over current-frame neighbourhoods, then push the elastic state
through the material's own return map, F_e[n+1] = project(F_incr F_e[n]),
per-particle algebra with nothing differentiated. Validated against the
stored elastic F it matches strain percentiles to the third decimal through
the active flow phase, and the at-cap flow set to a Jaccard overlap of
0.93. It still fails the momentum fit, for a measured reason: the per
particle direction alignment is 0.98, and those few-degree errors are
spatially correlated (the smoothing misdirects coherently near fronts), so
they do not average out of the assembled rows; the volumetric part drifts
multiplicatively (per-particle |dJ| reaches 0.23 at p95 during flow).
The self-consistent fit lands 2.3x high at relative residual 0.87 and the
residual gate refuses it. Substituting the true volumetric state halves the
residual to 0.5, so directions and volume share the blame. A direction-free
energy-balance reading (mechanical energy decay over the plastic
strain-rate integral) gives 7916 against 5000 at residual 0.36 and refuses
too; their trajectory's own numerical dissipation sits in its numerator.

What ships at this tier for the plastic materials is the rollout scan
(mpm_engine/experiments/nclaw/rollout_scan.py): the elastic pair is assumed
at its configured value and stated, and the single plastic parameter is
scanned by rolling the engine from the tier's own frame-0 seed and scoring
position MSE against the measured identify trajectory. No gradients pass
through the simulator; NCLaw's sys-id baseline optimizes the same objective
with a differentiable MPM. The objective is steep: 5 degrees of friction or
a factor two of yield costs a factor 25 to 45 in MSE. The scans return
phi = 24.5 degrees against a truth of 25.0 for sand and tau_y = 5000 Pa
against a truth of 5000 for plasticine, each at an objective value at or
below the correct-parameter score on the identify trajectory, which is the
finite-difference seed floor. Water keeps its weak-form volumetric fit as
primary since it does not refuse, but from moving-least-squares volume
readings on a splash that fit lands 37.5 percent low; the same scan run as
a variant leg lands on lam 57692 exactly. The tier's final count, in
docs/four_method_comparison.md: nineteen of twenty scenes beat the
published cells from positions alone, and the one loss is water's dataset
scene, where the finite-difference frame-0 seed already puts the
correct-parameter rollout above their published number.
