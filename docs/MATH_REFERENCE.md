# TrackEUCLID Mathematical Reference (docs/MATH_REFERENCE.md)

Math authority for all phases. When code and this document disagree, the document wins. G0 is the executable arbiter of every convention. Function-encoder training mathematics lives in docs/FUNCTION_ENCODER.md (Phase 3); only its interface contract appears here.

## 0. Coordinate convention (read first)

Config A (quasi-2D, plane strain): x horizontal, z vertical UPWARD, y out-of-plane. In-plane fields depend on (x, z, t) only; v_y = 0 and w_y = 0. The in-plane gravity vector is g = (0, -g_mag) with g_mag = 9.81. The out-of-plane normal stress is sigma_yy; it exists in plane strain and never enters in-plane rows. Scalar-gravity formulas (with explicit signs) appear ONLY inside common/conventions.py helpers and in Section 5 below; all assembly formulas use the gravity vector.

## 1. Continuum setting and constitutive family

  div v = 0
  rho Dv/Dt = div sigma + rho g
  sigma = -p I + tau

  D = sym(grad v),  (grad v)_{ij} = d v_i / d x_j
  |gamma_dot|_eps = sqrt(2 D : D + eps_gamma^2),  eps_gamma default 0.02 / s
  I = |gamma_dot|_eps d / sqrt(p / rho_s)
  tau = mu(I) p (2 D / |gamma_dot|_eps)

Pressure from a dumped 3D Cauchy stress, ALWAYS the 3D trace, never the 2D trace:

  p = -( sigma_xx + sigma_yy + sigma_zz ) / 3

implemented once as conventions.pressure_from_cauchy_3d_trace(...) with a unit test in which sigma_yy is nonzero.

Linear basis, load-bearing: mu(I) = sum_k theta_k phi_k(I).

Dictionary modes behind one interface (Section 7):
- Mode C: phi_1 = 1.
- Mode P: mu(I) = mu_s + sum_g c_g f_g(I), f_g(I) = I / (I + I_0g), I_0g on a log grid in [1e-3, 1], c_g >= 0 with L1 selection. f_g(0) = 0, f_g(inf) = 1, so mu_s rides the constant feature and sum c_g is the friction rise.
- Mode F: learned basis, Phase 3, docs/FUNCTION_ENCODER.md.

## 2. Weak form: full derivations

### 2.1 Master identity (acceleration form)

Patch Q = Omega_j x [t0, t1], test field w with w = 0 on the spatial patch boundary and div w = 0:

  INT_Q rho a . w = OINT (sigma n) . w - INT_Q sigma : grad w + INT_Q rho g . w

Compact support kills the boundary integral (all unknown tractions). sigma : grad w = -p (div w) + tau : D[w] = tau : D[w]. Hence

  INT_Q tau : D[w] = INT_Q rho (g - a) . w                          (M1)

Rows: A[j,k] = INT_Q phi_k(I) p (2 D / |gamma_dot|_eps) : D[w_j],  b[j] = INT_Q rho (g - a) . w_j. p and I are data; linearity in theta holds for fixed p.

### 2.2 Time-weak forms (no second derivatives of data)

Lagrangian (tracks), with w(., t0) = w(., t1) = 0 and m_p = rho V_p:

  INT_Q rho a . w = - SUM_p m_p INT v_p . [ dw/dt + (v_p . grad) w ](x_p(t), t) dt

Eulerian, fully weak, using incompressibility, constant rho, compact w, and outer product (v (x) v)_{ij} = v_i v_j:

  INT_Q rho a . w = - INT_Q rho [ v . dw/dt + (v (x) v) : grad w ]   (M2)

(x) denotes the tensor outer product, NOT a cross product. Both (M1 with measured a) and (M2 or the Lagrangian variant) are always implemented and reported; disagreement is a refusal component.

### 2.3 Momentum-closure diagnostic

For the true material (M1) holds for any admissible w. Near-rigid fields w = chi e_i (not divergence free) check the full identity including the closure pressure; strictly admissible bumps check the pressure-free identity. Per-patch relative closure error localizes bad kinematics, pressure, or masks. Built before any regression.

### 2.4 Quadrature

Particle quadrature INT f dV approx SUM_p V_p f(x_p); trapezoid in time. Convergence verified in G0 by halving particle spacing and frame interval; the observed rate sets all tolerances.

### 2.5 Production estimator on MPM data: grid-consistent (Bubnov-Galerkin) assembly

The analytic bump test functions of Sections 2-3 are the basis of G0 and of the divergence-free pressure analysis, but sampling them directly at MPM particle positions gives a biased estimator whose answer tracks the patch radius: on the constant-mu collapse (truth 0.38) the recovered mu rises monotonically from 0.13 at a 3-cell radius to 0.61 at 16 cells, with no clean limit, and the bias survives changes of particle count and of acceleration source. The production estimator instead takes the test functions from the simulator's own discrete space (the Bubnov-Galerkin choice, as in EUCLID, where the weights are the same nodal shape functions that interpolate the field): the background quadratic B-spline grid basis, reconstructed from particle positions and dx, with the internal force assembled through the same grad N_i operator P2G uses (ident/weakform/grid_assembly.py:assemble_grid_consistent). On the same dump this recovers mu = 0.384 at dx = 4 mm and 0.379 at dx = 2.67 mm, converging under grid refinement, and the estimate is stable under row stride and mask-threshold changes at the few-percent level.

The two test-function families trade off against each other, and the choice couples to the pressure source:

- Divergence-free bumps annihilate the pressure-gradient term, so a closure pressure enters only multiplicatively and the induced bias is the clean row-weighted mean of p_true/p_est of Section 5 (measured on the collapse: P0 and P1 under-predict the flowing-region pressure by roughly 1.7x, so mu is over-estimated by the same factor). Their weakness is the patch-scale bias above when sampled at raw particles.
- Grid-consistent B-spline functions are unbiased at finite resolution but are not divergence free, so the pressure gradient is a first-class term in b and the assembly needs the true (dumped) pressure. Feeding a P0/P1 closure breaks the balance outright (measured: mu_hat 0.07 to 0.08 vs truth 0.38).

The grid-consistent form with true pressure is the production method for all oracle-MPM gates; the bump form is retained for G0, for manufactured solutions, and for closure-pressure analysis on reconstructed smooth fields (Section 6.5), where it is both admissible and pressure-insensitive. When this document's bump prescription and the grid-consistent code disagree on an MPM dump, the grid-consistent code is the production method and this note records why, not a violation of the code-follows-document rule.

## 3. Test functions (Config A, in-plane coordinates x, z)

Generator along the out-of-plane axis: w = curl(eta e_y). Componentwise:

  w_x = - d eta / d z,    w_z = + d eta / d x,    w_y = 0,    div w = 0 identically.

Separable C2 generator on the space-time patch:

  eta(x, z, t) = r_x r_z B(u) B(s) B(q),  u = (x - x_c)/r_x,  s = (z - z_c)/r_z,  q = (t - t_c)/r_t
  B(zeta)  = (1 - zeta^2)^3            for |zeta| < 1, else 0
  B'(zeta) = -6 zeta (1 - zeta^2)^2
  B''(zeta) = 6 (1 - zeta^2)(5 zeta^2 - 1)

Explicit components and ALL gradient entries (implement these verbatim; do not re-derive):

  w_x = - r_x B(u) B'(s) B(q)
  w_z = + r_z B'(u) B(s) B(q)

  d w_x / d x = - B'(u) B'(s) B(q)
  d w_x / d z = - (r_x / r_z) B(u) B''(s) B(q)
  d w_z / d x = + (r_z / r_x) B''(u) B(s) B(q)
  d w_z / d z = + B'(u) B'(s) B(q)

Divergence check by inspection: d w_x / d x + d w_z / d z = 0. D[w] = sym(grad w) from these entries. Time compactness (B(q) factor) serves the time-weak form. Per patch: full scale, half scale centered, and an offset full-scale copy, 3 rows. Unit tests: div w = 0 to machine precision at random points, support containment, C1 continuity at the support boundary by finite differences, and a sign-flip negative control (Section 9).

3D (Config B, deferred): w = curl(eta c f), c in {e_x, e_y, e_z}, f in {1, finer bump}; same tests. Rigid and tool fields as before for diagnostics and force rows.

## 4. Masks and patches

Flowing mask: |gamma_dot|_eps > gamma_min (0.5 / s) AND I > I_min (1e-4). Validity mask: distance to front > c_f d (10), distance to free surface and base > c_s d (5), flowing-layer thickness h_flow / d > c_h (8) along the local inward surface normal, density criterion under the active density model. When the grain diameter is sub-grid (d < dx), the clearance lengths are floored at two grid cells; pure grain-diameter clearances let near-surface low-pressure particles through and inflate the realized I band by orders of magnitude. Gate transient: drop t < max(2 sqrt(d/g_mag), measured gate-clearance time, closure-diagnostic spike interval). Patches: space-time boxes in the mask intersection, stratified across realized-I deciles (the conditioning control for Modes P and F).

## 5. Pressure closures (signs derived, not assumed)

Vertical momentum with z upward, g_z = -g_mag, neglecting the deviatoric-stress divergence and horizontal coupling (exactly the neglect G1P prices):

  rho a_z = - d p / d z + rho g_z      =>      d p / d z = rho (g_z - a_z)

Integrating downward from the free surface where p(h) = 0:

  P1:  p(x, z, t) = INT from z to h(x,t) of rho ( a_z(x, z', t) + g_mag ) dz'
  P0:  p(x, z, t) = rho g_mag ( h(x, t) - z )         (the a_z = 0 limit of P1)

Required unit tests: P0 returns rho * 9.81 * (h - z) on a static column; P1 reduces to P0 when a_z = 0; both implemented only via conventions helpers, never with locally written signs. P1 is the default CANDIDATE closure; G1P decides admissibility. P2 (frozen-I alternation) is an engineering diagnostic only.

Bias structure: with p_est = p_true (1 + delta), the constant-mu estimator satisfies, to first order, mu_hat / mu = row-weighted mean of p_true / p_est. Away from the crossover the dominant effect of pressure bias is multiplicative in the recovered friction; near the mu(I) transition pressure also relabels I through I proportional to p^(-1/2) and can alter apparent rate dependence. The region-split diagnostic (8.4) catches both and depends only on locality.

Sensitivity operator: theta(p) = (A^T A + lambda G)^{-1} A^T b; dA has two channels per entry, the multiplicative p factor and the basis argument with d phi_k / d p = (d phi_k / d I)(-I / (2 p)). NOTE: this requires d phi / d I in PHYSICAL I, not d phi / d log10 I; see the interface contract in Section 7. Closed form, finite-difference checked in G0, propagated to var(mu(I)) = phi(I)^T Sigma_theta phi(I), validated against the ensemble.

## 6. Perception and kinematic reconstruction (Config A)

### 6.1 Geometry

Undistort (radial-tangential model k1, k2, p1, p2, k3). Homography H from the glass plane (x, z world) to pixels by DLT on AprilTag corners (6 or more tags), Levenberg-Marquardt refinement, metric scale from tag edge. Ensemble axis: corner jitter sigma_px = 0.3 px, refit, propagate.

### 6.2 Masks, surface, V_n

SAM2 mask, open-close radius 2 px, largest component. Free surface S(t) = boundary not adjacent to base, walls, gate; subpixel refinement via intensity-gradient maximum within 3 px of the boundary along image columns. V_n from signed distance functions: V_n approx [SDF_t - SDF_{t+dt}] / dt on S(t), n = grad SDF / |grad SDF|. Volume V(t) = mask area x W; phi(t) = m / (rho_s V(t)) is the dilation diagnostic.

### 6.3 Tracking

CoTracker3: uniform query grid (8 to 12 px spacing) in the mask, re-seeded every 0.1 s, windowed offline mode, visibility logits to confidence c_p, discard segments with c_p < 0.5 or homography-mapped inconsistency. Cross-check: classical PIV (32 x 32 px windows, 50 percent overlap, FFT correlation, three-point Gaussian subpixel peak). The track-vs-PIV velocity discrepancy field is a perception-uncertainty estimate and an ensemble axis.

### 6.4 Track derivatives and noise

Per-track weighted quadratic fits over N samples at spacing dt: v_hat = b, a_hat = 2c. Leading-order variances under iid position noise sigma_x:

  var(v_hat) approx 12 sigma_x^2 / (N^3 dt^2)
  var(a_hat) approx 720 sigma_x^2 / (N^5 dt^4)

At 500 fps, sigma_x = 0.2 mm, N = 25: std(v) about 0.004 m/s, std(a) about 0.6 m/s^2, below the order-g signal. The time-weak form removes a_hat entirely and is always run in parallel.

### 6.5 Streamfunction field fit (x, z)

psi(x, z, t) on tensor cubic B-splines (spatial knots about 2x mean inter-track spacing, temporal knots every 4 frames); v = curl(psi e_y), so v_x = - d psi / d z, v_z = + d psi / d x, divergence free by construction. Objective: confidence-weighted track misfit + lambda_n (v . n - V_n)^2 on S(t) + lambda_b base-condition misfit (model variant) + lambda_s |Laplacian psi|^2 + lambda_t |d psi / d t|^2. Regularizers by GCV, GCV(lambda) = (1/m)|(Id - S_lambda) y|^2 / [(1/m) tr(Id - S_lambda)]^2, Hutchinson trace, then frozen. Derived fields analytic; field-consistent acceleration a = dv/dt + (v . grad) v = dv/dt + L v with L_{ij} = d v_i / d x_j, so the contraction is L @ v. The dumped L uses the same convention: the probe that decides it fits dv_i/dx_j over each particle's neighbours and matches trajectory acceleration against dv/dt + L @ v versus dv/dt + L^T @ v (median relative error 0.023 for L, 0.89 for the transpose), and the dump records the answer in its L_convention metadata.

### 6.6 Ensemble axes

Homography jitter, mask erosion/dilation 1 to 2 px, surface method (SDF vs column gradient), track bootstrap 80 percent, confidence threshold 0.4 to 0.6, velocity source (tracks vs PIV), regularizers x3 and /3, base condition, density model (phi_0 vs phi(t)), pressure closure (P0 vs P1), mask constants halved and doubled, patch reseeding. 50 to 200 members; every downstream solve is milliseconds.

## 7. Dictionary interface (binding contract; Mode F details in docs/FUNCTION_ENCODER.md)

Assembly and solve code NEVER sees log coordinates. The interface takes physical inertial number I:

  Dictionary.K -> int
  Dictionary.phi(I: ndarray) -> ndarray (len(I), K)
  Dictionary.dphi_dI(I: ndarray) -> ndarray (len(I), K)        # physical-I derivative, used by the pressure sensitivity operator
  Dictionary.dphi_dlogI(I: ndarray) -> ndarray (len(I), K)     # = dphi_dI * I * ln(10); used only for monotonicity constraint rows
  Dictionary.gram(weight) -> ndarray (K, K)
  Dictionary.metadata -> dict (mode, support, nonnegativity pattern)

Implementations: ConstantDict, PouliquenGridDict, FunctionEncoderDict (table-backed; converts to s = log10 I internally; cubic interpolation; analytic chain rule for dphi_dI = dphi_ds / (I ln 10)). Mixing d phi / d I, d phi / d log I, and d phi / d p is the designated bug class for this module; the unit tests cross-check the three against finite differences on every implementation.

Encoding-through-linear-functionals lemma (why Mode F composes with EUCLID): the weak-form observations L_j[mu] = b_j are linear in mu, so A_jk = L_j[phi_k] and coefficient recovery is the same constrained least squares for every mode. Identifiability = column rank of A, governed by the basis Gram matrix and realized (I, D, w) diversity; hence I-stratified patches and joint multi-aspect-ratio systems.

## 8. Solve, uncertainty, diagnostics

8.1 Estimator: minimize |A theta - b|^2 + lambda theta^T G theta subject to C theta >= h (admissibility: mu >= mu_min on a log-I grid; optional monotonicity via dphi_dlogI rows; Mode P nonnegativity pattern). theta^T G theta = ||sum theta_k phi_k||^2 in L2_w. lambda by GCV or L-curve. Rows scaled by inertia-gravity magnitude; report cond(A^T A), effective rank at 1e-8, row-survival fraction. Caveat from the constant-mu gate: this row scaling up-weights low-signal rows and degraded the Mode C solve (0.039 scaled vs 0.21 unscaled at a 4-cell patch radius), so Mode C uses unscaled A-weighted least squares; revisit scaling for Mode P.

8.2 Conditional posterior: sigma_hat^2 = |r|^2 / (m - dof_lambda); Sigma_theta = sigma_hat^2 (A^T A + lambda G)^{-1} (heteroscedastic sandwich variant also implemented); bands var(mu(I)) = phi(I)^T Sigma_theta phi(I), drawn only over the observed I band; constraint-active cases by truncated-Gaussian sampling.

8.3 Ensemble posterior: mixture over members; envelope and quantiles; analytic pressure-sensitivity bands overlaid, agreement reported.

8.4 Region-split same-I consistency: R_front = flowing rows with front distance in [c_f d, 2 c_f d]; R_bulk = front distance > 4 c_f d and depth > 2 c_s d. Independent solves; agreement evaluated ONLY on the intersection of empirical I supports; require at least half a decade of overlap and at least 20 percent of each set's rows, else return INSUFFICIENT_OVERLAP. Disagreement beyond combined bands at matched I is the designated falsification signal for pressure closure or locality.

8.5 Sidewall column (Phase 2): f_w = -(2 mu_w p / W) v / |v|_eps; column A[j, wall] = INT (2 p / W)(v / |v|_eps) . w_j; mu_w fixed to tilt value or bounded, never free; principal-angle collinearity report per collapse and stacked; W/d material-variation tolerance fixed in advance: exceed the ensemble 90 percent band or 0.04 in friction coefficient, whichever larger, declares apparatus dependence.

8.6 Observability gating and dual-form agreement: reject rows whose ensemble variance exceeds half their magnitude; report survival fraction; acceleration-form vs time-weak mu(I) compared over the observed band, disagreement is a refusal component.

## 9. G0 protocol (expanded per review)

1. Trivial case FIRST: constant p, constant mu, simple analytic divergence-free v, one bump test function, both sides by dense quadrature. Must match to quadrature error.
2. Sign-flip NEGATIVE CONTROL: flipping the sign of b or of D[w] must fail by order one, not pass within tolerance. A G0 that cannot fail is not a gate.
3. Full manufactured solution: analytic v(x, z, t), p(x, z, t), mu(I); convergence under quadrature refinement sets all tolerances.
4. Derivative cross-checks: dictionary phi / dphi_dI / dphi_dlogI vs finite differences; sensitivity operator vs finite differences; test-function gradients vs finite differences.
5. Acceleration identity on oracle data: trajectory finite differences vs grid forces (if exposed) vs dv/dt + L @ v; the L-convention probe lives here.

## 10. Validation metrics (Stage 6)

Synthetic: weighted relative L2 of mu_hat over the realized band. Field: held-out-window velocity error. Observable: front trajectory x_f(t); deposit profile Hausdorff and area difference. Transfer: identify on a training subset of (a, W/d), validate on held-out (a, W/d); runout-vs-aspect-ratio against Lube and Lajeunesse scaling forms with fitted exponents and confidence intervals. Statics: low-I limit of mu_hat against the repose prior interval, consistency check only.
