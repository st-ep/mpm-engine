# Experiments

Paper studies and figure scripts. Unlike `../examples/`, these are kept for
reproducibility of specific results rather than as maintained demos: most encode one
study's protocol, several consume caches written by an earlier script, and some need
heavy extras (torch, CoTracker). Run them from the repository root with the project
environment active.

Rheology recovery (the shear-cell studies; all need `fe-weights/viscous.npz`):

- `shear_cell_3d.py`: 3D lift of the 2D shear cell (`examples/shear_cell_fe.py`); FE
  recovery plus a held-out rollout, writes `out/shear_cell_3d/rollout_3d.npz`.
- `strong_vs_weak.py`: strong-form (pointwise stress oracle) versus weak-form
  (wall-force power balance) recovery on the same sweeps.
- `dough_fe_viscous.py`: FE versus Bingham recovery of a shear-thinning dough at three
  press speeds.
- `correct_model_check.py`, `rollout_snapshots.py`, `rollout_error_contours.py`,
  `shear_rollout_video.py`: figures and videos built from `rollout_3d.npz`; run
  `shear_cell_3d.py` first.

Volume transfer and real-data protocol:

- `predict_volume_franka.py`: learn the law on one squeeze, predict plate force on a
  different-volume blob.
- `predict_volume_rollout.py`: predict deformation of an unseen volume, validated
  through the render-and-CoTracker pipeline.
- `realdata_pipeline.py`: the real-data-shaped ingest (textured video plus force CSV to
  rheology) exercised on synthetic renders at two volumes.
- `volume_holdout_check.py`: the 2x2 cross-volume held-out matrix; run
  `realdata_pipeline.py` first.

Manipulation planning and baselines:

- `shape_planning.py`: CEM shape planner over the MPM engine (Chamfer and EMD losses).
- `transfer_identify_plan.py`: identify on a small block, plan shaping on a large one;
  the size-transfer study.
- `three_prong.py`, `dough_franka_threeprong.py`: three-jaw shaping, standalone and
  arm-mounted.
- `gripper_render_dough.py`: PyVista render of the `examples/gripper_shape.py` plan.
- `gns_baseline.py`: a graph-network simulator baseline (torch) trained on engine
  rollouts, planned with the same CEM, against the identified-MPM forward model.

Perception and rendering studies:

- `rollout_franka_cotracker.py`: arm squeeze rendered as speckle, deformation extracted
  with CoTracker3, rollout error computed.
- `rollout_force_video.py`: side-by-side render with a live force trace; needs
  `rollout_franka_cotracker.py`'s output.
- `speckle_particle_videos.py`, `surface_track_test.py`: speckle-render inputs for
  tracking, and smooth-versus-textured surface trackability.

Recorded hardware pour (ep0001 of `pouring_real_data/`; the twin is
`examples/pour_recorded_twin.py`, every step writes to `out/pour_wf/<episode>/`):

- `pour_calibrate_geometry.py`: the twin's Stage-0 constants from the side camera's
  depth stream (table height, receiver center, held-cup grasp shift), by fitting the
  caliper cup ellipse to pre-pour depth points; its liquid-surface read is indicative
  only (the IR pattern penetrates the glycerol).
- `pour_perception.py`: amber segmentation and ray/cavity level fits, giving the
  receiver curve V(t), the cup poses, and the floor-crop onset (`observations.npz`).
- `pour_weakform_identify.py`: the time-weak brink lubrication fit, giving eta_hat with
  its statistical error and the fill-tolerance systematic; `--selftest` runs the
  manufactured-solution gate of the slender-jet estimator.
- `pour_validate.py`: the twin at eta_hat and every archived comparison twin against
  the real curve (finals, rms, like-for-like onsets) plus the side-by-side video.
- `pour_hold_sweep.py`: the hold-time lookup table for metering a target volume: the twin
  run with the cup held at the roll's end pose for each dwell (`--hold` in the twin), at
  eta_hat and at the handbook value; `--plan V` prints the dwell to command for a target.
- `pour_note_figures.py`: the figures of the walkthrough note (`docs/`, personal).
- `pour_franka_calibrate.py`: the honey pour's two measured constants, the spout
  azimuth baked into CUP_TO_HAND and the stream-landing receiver position.

Design:

- `pressure_covariance_sweep.py`: information-matrix and covariance study of the
  (tau_y, eta) weak form across press loads.
