"""Cross-volume held-out test for the real-data pipeline.

realdata_pipeline.run() identifies a law from each volume's own video+force and re-simulates
it at the same volume, so its 1x/1.5x numbers are per-volume self-consistency, not a held-out
generalization (the report caption overstated this). This evaluates the full 2x2 matrix: each
recovered law (identified on 1x, identified on 1.5x) re-simulated at both volumes. The diagonal
reproduces the self-rollout, and the off-diagonal measures transfer between volumes. The
re-simulation uses the warp-mpm kernel without CoTracker.

Run:  .venv/bin/python -m experiments.robotics.volume_holdout_check
