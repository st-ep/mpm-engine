"""NCLaw-matched comparison: identify from one cube throw, roll out on their shapes.

NCLaw (ICML 2023) learns a neural constitutive law by differentiating an MPM
rollout, from ONE thrown-blob trajectory per material, and reports the
box-normalized per-particle position MSE on the training scene and on a
held-out geometry. This runs their protocol with our engine and our weak-form
identification: the law comes from a convex, linear-in-theta solve on the cube
trajectory alone, the simulator is never differentiated, and the recovered law
is then re-simulated on the cube and on held-out shapes.

Protocol, from NCLaw/experiments/configs (verified):
  0.5 m cube of particles centred at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) in a unit box, thrown with
  linear velocity [1.0, -1.5, -2.0] and angular velocity [4, 4, 4] in their
  y-up frame, freeslip walls with a 3-cell bound, 1000 steps of dt 5e-4 = 0.5 s.
  Our frame is z-up, so the throw and gravity are rotated by the same proper
  rotation (their +y becomes our +z) and our engine picks its own stable dt.

Stages:
  gen       truth trajectories for the cube and the evaluation shapes
  identify  recover the law from the CUBE trajectory only
  rollout   re-simulate every scene at the recovered law, score the MSE
  report    results.json plus report.md plus the comparison figure
  cross     the cross-engine chain on a folder of THEIR trajectories: ingest,
            identify, roll out from their frame-0 cloud, score

Run:
  .venv/bin/python -m experiments.nclaw.suite gen      --material jelly --shapes cube,bunny
  .venv/bin/python -m experiments.nclaw.suite identify --material jelly
  .venv/bin/python -m experiments.nclaw.suite rollout  --material jelly --shapes cube,bunny
