"""Derivative-free system identification by rollout scan, one parameter.

The weak-form estimators refuse at the positions-only tier for the two
plastic materials. Their momentum fits need the per-particle elastic state,
and rebuilding that state from 1000-particle positions leaves spatially
correlated direction and volume errors that the residual gate catches
(the measured chain is in replay.py; the fit machinery itself recovers the
yield stress to 1.5 percent when handed the true hidden state). What survives
at this tier is the evaluation metric itself: roll the engine at a candidate
parameter from the tier's own frame-0 seed and score position MSE against the
measured identify trajectory. The scan is one dimensional and never
differentiates the simulator. NCLaw's sys-id baseline optimizes the same
objective with a differentiable MPM, so this uses the same information.

Elastic parameters are ASSUMED at their configured values and stated in the
result; only the plastic parameter is scanned. The objective is steep near
its minimum for both materials, measured on the dataset throws: a 5 degree
friction offset or a 2x yield offset costs a factor 25 to 45 in MSE, so a
coarse grid plus two refinement rounds resolves the parameter.
