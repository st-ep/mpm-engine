# Examples

The scripts run at CPU smoke-test size with no arguments and write to `out/`. Pass
`--device cuda:0` to select a GPU. `common.py` contains the shared shear-rate measure,
Chamfer metric, ffmpeg frame encoder, Franka descent calibration, and particle-cloud
surfacing code.

Manipulation and coupling:

- `dough_franka_press.py`: two-way force-feedback press. An admittance law descends the
  gripper and stops when the measured dough reaction reaches a target force.
- `squeeze_plate_franka.py`: arm-mounted plate squeeze that recovers the dough's
  (tau_y, eta) from the plate reaction force alone, cross-validated against the 2D
  squeeze-flow result.
- `wrist_ft_franka.py`: compares the MPM grid-impulse reaction on a dynamic MuJoCo
  Franka with the wrist force-torque sensor reading.
- `gripper_shape.py`: press to identify the material, then plan 2-finger grips (CEM over
  grip positions and widths) that sculpt the dough to a target shape. Modes: `demo`,
  `plan`, `video`, `tshape`.

Pouring:

- `pour_franka.py`: a Franka pours honey between two copies of the measured 500 mL
  measuring cup of the hardware experiment (`geometry/measuring_cup.py`: elliptical
  taper, spout and handle from calipers, an exact cavity inside a thickened collision
  wall). It records per-frame metrics, wrench readouts for both cups, and a leak audit.
  Simulation and rendering can run in separate processes on GPU clusters; see the
  script header and docs/performance.md. The Genesis-glass version with the
  `--glass cdf` comparison is in history at commit 592b60b.
- `pour_glass.py`: minimal mesh-to-SDF pour, the API demo for arbitrary watertight mesh
  colliders.
- `pour_recorded_twin.py`: twin of a recorded hardware pour. It replays the Franka joint
  log of an episode through forward kinematics, pours dyed glycerol from the measured
  cup into an identical receiver, and writes the transfer curve, wrenches and a
  side-by-side video against the real camera. Needs the episode under
  `pouring_real_data/` (outside the repository); `experiments/pour/` consumes it.

Identification:

- `vonmises_identify.py`: (G, yield) of a von-Mises dough from one squeeze probe, via a
  two-window power balance on the plate force.
- `shear_cell_fe.py`: wide-shear-rate 2D shear cell; recovers the apparent-viscosity
  curve eta_app(gd) on a learned basis and validates it by re-simulating a held-out
  shear speed. Needs `fe-weights/viscous.npz`.

Rendering:

- `dough_surface_render.py`: surface the particle cloud with marching cubes and render
  the dough as a continuous body. Needs the `surface` extra (scipy, scikit-image).
- `splat_sim.py`: Gaussian-splat scene, PhysGaussian style. Drops a splat body, fills its
  interior, then presses it with a scripted box collider; covariances advect and the SH
  rotate with the deformation. `--ply` loads a real checkpoint; `--record-splats` writes
  viewer frames; `--bake OUT.npz` compresses the run into temporal B-splines and
  `--from-bake IN.npz` re-exports viewer frames at any frame count from the bake.
  Needs the `splats` extra (plyfile, scipy).

Floods and rigid bodies:

- `flood_vehicle.py`: a water surge hits a splat-captured vehicle held as one rigid
  body; grid momentum becomes body force and torque, so pushing, floating, and
  overturning come out of the coupling (at 25 cm depth and 3 m/s a 150 kg/m^3 truck
  floats up and rolls onto its side). Records displacement from the spawn center
  and yaw/pitch/roll per frame; `--vehicle` takes any 3DGS PLY or watertight mesh,
  `--depth` and `--velocity` set the surge. The same scene is importable
  (`warpmpm.vehicle.FloodScene`) for parameter studies.

`recovery/` holds the constitutive-recovery examples (elastic and plastic drops,
sequential identification, sample complexity); see its README. Paper studies and figure
scripts live in `../experiments/`.
