# Authors and provenance

`warpmpm` (this package) is a robot-manipulation MPM engine: a typed solver wrapper, a
composable material factory, a force-feedback coupling backend, a MuJoCo adapter, and the
vendored Warp MLS-MPM kernels it drives (`src/warpmpm/kernels/`). The numerical core began as
an external academic project and was extended by our group. This file records who wrote what
and what to cite.

## Vendored numerical core (`src/warpmpm/kernels/`)

The explicit MLS-MPM solver, the quadratic B-spline transfer, and the base materials
(ids 0-8: jelly, metal, sand, foam, snow, plasticine, fluid, stationary, rigid) come from
the UCLA **warp-mpm** of Zeshun Zong and collaborators (Chenfanfu Jiang's group). It is used
in their published work and must be cited when this engine is used.

Original upstream contributors (from the fork's git history):
- Zeshun Zong and the MultiPLES group (UCLA): the original solver and base materials.
- supertan0204: the weakly-compressible fluid material.

The upstream warp-mpm carries no license file, so the vendored core is included on the same
terms it was released under. It is kept isolated in `kernels/` so the boundary stays clear.

## Group extensions (UT Austin) on top of that core

Layered onto the upstream solver by our group (from git authorship):
- **Cheng-Hsi Hsiao** (`chhsiao@utexas.edu`): moving robot colliders with a velocity boundary,
  multi-material scenes, rigid-body and restitution boundaries, a point-cloud loader, and the
  Warp 1.x compatibility fixes.
- **Krishna Kumar** (`krishnak@utexas.edu`): the Newton-exact grid-impulse contact-force
  (wrist-FT) readout on the velocity collider.
- The added constitutive models (ids 9-13: `mu_i_sand`, `newtonian`/Bingham/Herschel-Bulkley,
  `mu_i_phi`, `tabulated_viscous`, `tabulated_mu_i`), the local mu(I) / TrackEUCLID granular
  return mappings, and the dough fluid.

Everything outside `kernels/` (the `Solver` wrapper, `Material` factory, `coupling/` backend,
`adapters/` MuJoCo, scenes, examples, tests) is group-authored.
## Borrowed transfer-kernel design: claymore (MIT)

The Step 5 transfer-pipeline optimizations (the fused G2P2G particle pass, per-block
particle binning/sorting, and the shared-memory arena design earmarked for the CUDA
follow-up) port the architecture of **claymore**, read from Justin Bonus's fork
(github.com/JustinBonus/claymore, ClaymoreUW lineage: multi-architecture builds and
the OSU wave-flume/debris engineering projects). Claymore is MIT-licensed; design and
any adapted fragments are used with citation:
